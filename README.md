# CDP (Chrome DevTools) PDF generator service

Purpose of this PoC is to determine the efforts and feasibility of using a Chrome browser's capability to render the PDF files from HTML.

Here we are using [cdp](https://github.com/mafredri/cdp) here. It is a protocol driver library of [chrome-devtools-protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol) written in the Go programming language.

The Chrome DevTools Protocol allows the external program to communicate with a running instance of Chrome to instrument, inspect and debug it.

(To run Chrome headless in container, using https://github.com/alpeware/chrome-headless-trunk)
